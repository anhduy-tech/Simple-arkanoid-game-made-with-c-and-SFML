# Arkanoid Game

## About
This is a simple Arkanoid game I created as a fun learning project. I got bored with web development one afternoon and decided to try learning game development with C++ using the SFML library. The game features Haru Urara-inspired graphics for a fun and personal touch!

## How to Play
- **Controls**:
  - Use **Left Arrow** or **Right Arrow** to move the paddle.
  - The ball starts moving when you press Left or Right the first time.
  - **Space**: Replay the game after Game Over.
  - **Q**: Quit the game.
- **Objective**:
  - Break all the blocks by bouncing the ball off the paddle.
  - Each block type gives different points:
    - `block01.png`: 1 point
    - `block02.png`: 2 points
    - `block03.png`: 3 points
    - `block04.png`: 4 points
    - `block05.png`: 5 points
  - Avoid letting the ball fall off the bottom of the screen, or it's Game Over!

## Notes
- This is a learning project, so it might have some bugs or rough edges.
- The game includes Haru Urara-themed graphics for the paddle, ball, or blocks, just for fun!
- If you have issues running the game, ensure all files are in the correct folders and check your system's compatibility.

## Credits
